# codewars-challenge

This Android app uses :
 * MVP
 * Dagger 2
 * Android Architecture Component (Room, Paging Library)
 * RxJava
 * Clean Architecture
 * Repository pattern
 * JUnit & Mockito
 * Java and Kotlin for the model classes

Application notes :
 * The app is compatible offline
 * Need some extra work to have the app to survive configuration change and process deaths initiated by the system.
